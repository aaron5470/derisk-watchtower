# Specification Quality Checklist: DeRisk Watchtower

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items validated successfully. The specification is ready for the planning phase.

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality** (4/4 passed):
- ✅ Implementation details properly scoped to "In Scope" section without prescribing HOW
- ✅ User stories focus on borrower value and judge/observer experience
- ✅ Language is accessible to business stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

**Requirement Completeness** (8/8 passed):
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements fully specified
- ✅ All 16 functional requirements are testable with clear MUST statements
- ✅ All 15 success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- ✅ Success criteria written without implementation details (e.g., "Users can view HF within 3 actions" vs "React component renders in <1s")
- ✅ 4 user stories with complete Given/When/Then scenarios (16 total acceptance scenarios)
- ✅ 7 edge cases identified with mitigation approaches
- ✅ In/Out scope clearly bounded; 8 assumptions and 7 dependencies documented
- ✅ Risks table includes 8 scenarios with mitigation strategies

**Feature Readiness** (4/4 passed):
- ✅ Each FR mapped to user story acceptance criteria
- ✅ User scenarios span P1-P4 priorities covering MVP → full feature set
- ✅ 15 measurable success criteria enable objective feature validation
- ✅ Scope boundaries section prevents implementation detail leakage

## Notes

- Specification incorporates ETHOnline 2025 hackathon constraints (2-4 min demo, Hacker Dashboard submission, max 3 partner prizes)
- Constitution compliance checklist integrated for hackathon deliverables
- Four prioritized user stories enable incremental delivery (P1=MVP, P2-P4=enhancements)
- No clarifications needed - specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
